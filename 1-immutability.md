# The Dao of Immutability (The Way of the Function Programmer)

## Forward

"Sometimes, the elegant implementation is just a function. Not a method. Not a class. Not a framework. Just a function." ~Carmack

**Immutability**: The true constant is change. Mutation hide change. Hidden change manifests chaos. Therefore, the wise embrace history.

**Separation**: Logic is thought. Effects are action. Therefore the wise think before acting, and act only when the thinking is done.

**Coposition**: All things in nature work in harmony. A tree cannot grow without water. A bird cannot fly without air. Therefore the wise mix ingredients together to make their soup taste better.

**Wisdom**: The wise programmer understands the way before walking the path. Therfore the wise programmer is function, while the unwise get losat in the jungle.
